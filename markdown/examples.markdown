## Examples

The following examples will use the StashBoard REST API to create a service, create a status, and then create an event with the new status for the new service. The examples are for Python, Ruby, and PHP. 

If you haven't already, head over to the [API Credentials section](/documentation/credentials) to obtain your API key. Please note that you must be an administrator to make changes via the REST API.

### Python

This example will use the great [python-oauth2](http://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2) library by Leah Culver.
